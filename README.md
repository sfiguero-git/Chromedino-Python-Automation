## Demo video (Python and Arduino versions): https://youtu.be/bz1vA3rF-I8
## Running the script
Download the **chromedino_auto.py** file and the images dir (which by default only includes one single image for this demo). To run the script use the following command:

`python chromedino_auto.py`

Once the script is running a _spacebar_ input will be simulated/sent whenever the target image (dino.png) is not detected. The process can be stopped by pressing _CTRL+C_ on the same terminal that you used to call the script. If you are using multiple monitors, then your primary one will be used by default for image detection.
